## Abstract
This research investigates the role of image resolution enhancement through interpolation techniques in improving the performance of machine learning (ML) models. Image resolution has a profound impact on ML tasks, as higher-resolution images often contain more detailed features, which can lead to improved model accuracy, particularly in domains like medical imaging and satellite imagery. This study explores various interpolation methods, including traditional approaches (e.g., bilinear, bicubic) and advanced deep learning-based techniques (e.g., super-resolution convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks), to evaluate their efficacy in enhancing image quality and the subsequent performance of ML models. The research focuses on medical imaging, where improved resolution can aid in more accurate disease detection (e.g., tumor detection in MRI/CT scans) and medical image segmentation, as well as satellite imagery, where higher resolution can enhance object detection and land use classification.

We assess the impact of increased image resolution on the accuracy and robustness of ML models using both quantitative metrics (e.g., classification accuracy, segmentation overlap) and qualitative analyses (e.g., visual inspection of model predictions). Additionally, we examine potential trade-offs associated with resolution enhancement, including noise amplification, overfitting, and the computational costs of processing higher-resolution data. Through this investigation, we aim to determine whether interpolated high-resolution images consistently lead to improved ML outcomes or whether the benefits are domain-dependent. Our findings will contribute to the growing body of knowledge in image processing and machine learning, offering insights into how resolution enhancement can optimize model performance in critical fields such as healthcare, remote sensing, and environmental monitoring.
